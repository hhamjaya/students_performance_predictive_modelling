# Mini Project II – Students Performance

## Project description
The data was collected from a fully online nine-week-long course on machine learning, hosted on the online learning management system Moodle. The goal of this project is to use two different supervised learning approaches (of your choice) to predict students’ final grade in an online course.

## Data description
The dataset contained anonymized informa2on rela2ng to 107 enrolled students. The data included students’ grades (from 3 mini projects, 3 quizzes and 3 peer reviews and the final overall grade) as well as the course logs. The deadline for the three mini projects fell within weeks 3, 5 and 8 of the course, whereas the deadline for the quizzes fell within weeks 2, 4 and 8.

## Step 1- Data Processing
Are there any missing values? What are your features? Are you keeping every feature?

## Step 2 – Data split: Training and Test sets
Divide your data in an appropriate proportion to train and test dataset.

## Step 3 – Model Training
Train two models to predict students’ final grade using two different approaches of your choice. How accurately does your models predict the students’ final grade and how do these models compare against each other? Which one is better? Could you explain why?

## Step 4 – Performance Evaluation
How are your models performing? Do you need to change anything in your model? Visualize the performance of your models.

## Step 5 – Important features
What are the three most important features in predicting students’ final grade?
